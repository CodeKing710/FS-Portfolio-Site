    Carter's Web Portfolio

    This website contains a detailed portfolio of all my code projects
    html_includes will be used as embedded iframes so the code can run separate from the main page
    Real question: Will having too many embedded iframes create lag and memory issues?

                <hr />
                <p>I started teaching myself to program when I was 12 and kept learning ever since. Now that I am old enough to be in the job field I decided to try and get my credentials ASAP so I can start applying.</p>
                <h3><a href="./projects.html">My Projects</a></h3>
                <p>Here is a small preview of some of the projects I have done. None of these previews are super impressive and are just little functions and tools made to just process data.</p>
                <div>
                    <h4>String Reversal</h4>
                    <label for="revin">Input String: </label><input type="text" name="revin" id="strrev" />
                    <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="revStr()">Reverse!</a>
                    <p id="revStrOut"></p>
                    <script>
                        function revStr() {
                            var str = document.getElementById("strrev").value;
                            //Process array in reverse
                            var rev = [];
                            for(var i = str.length-1; i >= 0; i--)
                                rev.push(str[i]);

                            document.getElementById("revStrOut").innerHTML = rev.join("");
                        }
                    </script>
                </div>

                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I am a 7 year self-taught programmer, proficient in many langauges but no prior record of work experience in the software field. In high school I wanted to make some extra side money so I built a website for a small business in town. The website doesn't have a back-end because they didn't think it was necessary to have a database with the amount of housing that they had available. The website is still live as of <span id="currentDate"></span> and resides at <a href="http://www.uworent.com" target="_blank">www.uworent.com</a> if you would like to check it out (Link also in projects). </p>
                <script>
                    document.getElementById('currentDate').innerText = String(new Date().getUTCMonth()+1)+'-'+new Date().getUTCDate()+'-'+new Date().getUTCFullYear();
                </script>
                <p>If you checked out the website above you may have noticed that the current color scheme is a common one for me, turns out it is for a lot of people.</p>
